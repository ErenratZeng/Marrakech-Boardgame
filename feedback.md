Congratulations on finishing the assignment and passing all test cases!

The UI implementation is excellent, the idea of integrating CSS style into JavaFX is brilliant. Also, the different levels of AI implementation are well-designed and make the game more interesting.

The overall code quality is high. However, it would be beneficial to add more comment messages to make the code more readable, especially for the AI implementations.
