### Comments

- What are the best features of this code?
  <br/>The writer creates an instance of the class that is initialized with information in the form of a string representation, 
  i.e. stores the appropriate information in the instance of the class to achieve an internalized string representation of the game state.

- Is the code well-documented?
  <br/>Yes, the author explained the role of each function, the meaning of the variables and the specific explanation of how to use it.

- Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?
  <br/>Yes, each class has clear responsibilities, which helps to keep the code modular and maintainable. 
  For example, Board is responsible for managing the state of the chessboard, 
  and Player is responsible for managing the state of the players; 
  the function of each method It is very clear and helps to improve the readability and maintainability of the code; 
  in addition, some basic error handling is carried out in many places, 
  and runtime exceptions are thrown to inform users of certain unexpected situations.

- Does it follow Java code conventions (for example, are methods and variables properly named), and is the style
  consistent throughout?
  <br/>Yes, the author uses camel case naming for variables and ensures this both inside and outside the interface.

- If you suspect an error in the code, suggest a particular situation in which the program will not function correctly.
  <br/>No problem.
